# Usage

Docker, as well as docker compose, is needed.
Clone this repository.
A docker compose file is provided to make it simple to run the dotnet test app. So from your local folder:

## Using docker-compose

```console
$ DD_API_KEY=<yourkey> docker-compose up
```

Alternatively, you can add custom response templates via environment variables.

```console
$  DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_HTML=/app/blocked.html DD_APPSEC_HTTP_BLOCKED_TEMPLATE_JSON=/app/blocked.json DD_API_KEY=<yourkey> docker-compose up
```

### Environment variables

Env variables are defined in the docker-compose, feel free to choose your own configuration,
it can be useful to change DD_ENV to make it something recognizable to you

## Attacking the app

You should be able to attack the app on port 7777 of your machine.
For now, blocking is active on every rule, only request that don't trigger a security alert will pass.

### curl commands

```console

$ curl http://localhost:7777
